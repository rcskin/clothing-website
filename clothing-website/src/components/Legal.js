/* Note to Reviewer:
I wasn't sure what a legal page needed and there is lots of information
that is typically found on these pages so cannot fill this with actual 
information. I understand that the task is to show our knowledge and skill 
of making routed pages, so I have included a list of things you would typically
see on a website's legal page
